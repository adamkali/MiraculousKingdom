Players can also spend King's favor, which is a special resource, to gain tokens or experience. This can be used to give a player an edge in the event resolution.

### Event Resolution: 
After all actions and resolution have been made, players resolve the event based on the outcome of the event, the players' actions, and the influence of King's favor. The resolution can be determined by a GM or through a vote of the players. For example if the king would approve of how one of the player's handled the situation during role play they may gain more experience, more tokens, or more favor. It is up to everyone to make their case and is ultimately up to the other players to decide how the event will resolve.
