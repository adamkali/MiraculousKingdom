# A Junior Developer's Journey in 2023: The Phantom Pain

Hello welcome all of my 0 subscribes to a new video that has never been done before. Making a youtube video about making a side project in the year of our lord 2023. Now before I begin: I want to drop a little knowledge about myself.

I am a Full Stack Engineer with React and .Net. it is my first job in tech where all I have done has been writing code. And since this company is in the late stages of the startup phase, it means that I have some good job security and nothing will ever go wrong.

So I being one of three developers at a company, and being the only neovim chad athe company means that I have a superiority complex. So I am going to start making my own side project. Obviously. And what is a better way to start a side project then starting a backend with the favorite language of the site that people go to when they don't know how to code. Let's go.

## The Highs of Rust

Now because I am a neovim Gigachad and I have my thigh high socks ready to go for when i post on r/unixsocks behind my wife's back; I am ready to write software in rust. 

Now if you have never heard anything about rust, Not endorsed by the rust foundation by the way and not financial advice, you should now that rust is kindof fast.

I have started projects before with rust mainly with actix, but the macro system for me was not ergonomic and i did not have a fun time. So when i started my research into what i wanted my backend framework to be, I went with AXUM. Written by the same people who made Tokio wich is the MSG of Rust programming. Take a little bit of Tokio sprinkle that into your project and bing bang boom, now you got preformance baby and flavor. lets go!!!!! 

Anyhow, I start writting my rust code and ope its already done. Yeah I am kind of suprised how good writting any endpoints in axum is whether its writing a database call or using your own datastructures for data manipulation as long as you return back the Jason object. Oh hi jason, your all gucci gang.

Also shout out to utoipa for having a great swagger ui. Go use them if you want to test your endpoints, or yell at me in the comments. I dont know its a free country if you are as white as I am.

However, the thing that I was most suprised by was the fact that everything felt natural and how I thought that it should work. If i wanted a get object, I could give it a response trait so that it did not use any non serializable objects. Do i want to call the database, sure just wrap that bitch in and await it. Im not your dad.

At the end of the day, I was most impressed by being able to develop the software and not hope that i am developing the software. Wich are two very different things. Which takes me to my next phase

## Next 13: The bane of my existence

Now i am not knocking anyone who uses next 13, but i must be missing something because this was absolute hell for me. I think i spent more time hoping that trying to wire up the backend to next would work only to find out that there was something wrong with how i was making th application. Like how apparently useState is just null sometimes even though Next 13 is just react with extra steps. So I took so much time developing the non-dependent part of the app and making sure that it look pretty before even testing to make sure that the data got rendered on the frontend, and that makes me depressed. 

Now let me be clear i am sure that this is all my fault. I have no preconsived notions about it; However, when using next it jest seemed like the proverbial foot gun was always loaded and i was a crying wojack asking the Next dommy mommy to please stop kicking my balls because this wasnt fun anymore while poor daddy Tokio was tied up in a corner crying sweet silent tears as he watched. Sorry for giving you that mental image.

## My next steps

so after two weeks of developing my rust code and another week of trying to develop a next 13 frontend I said enough is enough and deleted the frontend. Yes I know. But i was not having fun with debugging not developing. Which was what i was talking about before. I dont want to be Debugging my build environment, so that i can start developing. I want to develop and have my build environment just work. Wich it wasn't with Next 13 even if it wasn't Next 13's fault i was still feeling frustrated because i was getting cut by the bleeding edge. Which yes i do understand the irony of using rust as a backend and then also complainging about bleeding edge. The irony is not lost on me. 

I think my next step is just to find a good frontend that is not react because. I do not want to use react. I am still not sure if i want to jump into Leptos, because if i start leptos I am scared of using nightly witch is just more bleeding edge. 

I think my main choice now is Svelte and Solid. They both use nice declaritive syntax and it is nice to use. So Yeah i guess this is the end of my first Youtube video if you liked it, go talk to your local crack head and ask him about the cia. If you disliked it tell your favorite twitch streamer to watch it so that they can roast me. Ok bye!
