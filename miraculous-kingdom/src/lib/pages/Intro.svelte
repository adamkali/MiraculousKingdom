            The Miraculous Kingdom is a  <b>TTRPG: Table Top Role Playing Game</b> designed behind subtrafuge, lies, and backstabbing. But more importantly, this is a game about having fun!  The attide should be as follows:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="width-full text-lg flex-col justify-center py-12 px-24">
        <ul >
            <li class="no-underline pb-4"> => Your friend backstabs you during an important roll.</li>
            <li class="no-underline pb-4"> => You pop off in game and sabotage your friend back!</li> 
            <li class="no-underline pb-4"> => In reality, you are having fun because their character acted in game not your friend backstabbing in real life.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="width-full text-xl flex justify-center mb-24 px-16">
        <p>
            At the end of the day yu are making a story for you and your friends. When playing the game, always frame what you are trying to accomplish, not what you are trying to do. This game is not made to be played with a game master, so you and your friends are in charge of coming to an agreement of what rewards should be dished out.
