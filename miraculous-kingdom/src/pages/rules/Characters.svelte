        important of questions. What is your character's name? Remember that
        this is also a table top rpg on top of a deck building card game. You
        are going to <b class="font-bold">be</b> this character for the entire
        game unless if you use the <b class="font-bold">Heir</b><Special
            href="/rules/abilities">Ability</Special
        >. Regardless you will have to create a character. So naming your
        character is an important first step. You will next you should choose
        your class, As this will help you in choosing what Might you will
        prioritize. If you have not taken a look yet, Taking a look at the <Special
            href="/rules/classes">Classes</Special
        > Page will serve you immensely.

        With choosing a Character Name and a Character Class, it is time to start
        rolling your <Special href="/rules/mights">Might</Special>. by rolling a
        six six sided die, you will generate your Might. It is suggested as
        well, that well that when rolling your Might that you reroll any ones
        that you get. Then choose which might will get which roll.
