    Have you ever wanted to backstab your friends and still retain your
    friendship? Well then this is the game! Welcome to the Miraculous
    Kingdom. Miraculous Kingdom is a deck building game about
    backstabbing, skullduggery, and betrayal. Each Character
    has its own Class with its own cards called Abilities. Take turns
    leveaging abilities through out the game to get more resources,
    abilities, and strategies to win the round called a Season.
    Think of this game as a season or an arc in one of your favorite
    dramas like Game of Thrones, Last of Us, or The Wire.

    <p class="text-3xl text-slate-100 mb-2">
    To begin a game: Go to <a href="/create">Create</a>
    and make a setting for your game. Have the rest of your friends using
    the password you get from the server and have them to go to 
    <a href="/start/join">here</a> and Roll Might for your character.
    Each one will have an effect on how you play. Choose your class, and
    at the beginning of the game get 10 abilities plus the 8 that you get
    from your class. Then after rolling a season from the server you will
    get a special case for how the next couple of rounds (one rotation of
    everyone playing). Each round the roll a 20 sided dice, or use the application,
    to figure out the order of the round. Then take your turn. This will
    keep going until a game ending ability is played and its conditions are
    met. A game ending ability is denoted on the ability's card face.
