                Welcome to the Miraculous Kingdom, a game of scumduggery,
                backstabbing, and conspiracy. You are a member of a royal
                council of the kingdom, and you are trying to influence the
                monarch to make decisions that will benefit you and your
                faction. Using your abilities and might, you will try to either 
                take control of the kingdom, destroy it from within, or save it 
                from the other players. If you have not played before, please
                read the rules before playing. Have fun!
